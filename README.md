### Additional options and defaults

```
You can optionally add a preview hash that includes section and set vars. f.e.
 preview: { section: :primary_color_section, set_vars: %w(mdc-theme-primary mdc-theme-background)}

This will update the css vars in the defined section with the color returned by the picker
